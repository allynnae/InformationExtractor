# Multi-Document Information Extractor

A command-line application that uses large language models to automatically extract information from multiple documents and answer user-defined questions.

## Overview

Searching for information across multiple documents is time-consuming and often requires reasoning beyond simple keyword matching. This project presents a command-line application that uses large language models to automate information extraction from multiple documents. The system reads documents in various formats, processes user-defined questions, and outputs structured answers with source attribution. Performance is tracked using Weights and Biases.

## Features
