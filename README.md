## Overview

Searching for information across multiple documents is time-consuming and often requires reasoning beyond simple keyword matching. This project presents an application that uses large language models to automate information extraction from multiple documents. The system reads documents in various formats, processes user-defined questions, and outputs structured answers with source attribution. Performance is tracked using Weights and Biases.
